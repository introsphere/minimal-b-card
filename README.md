<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a submission to the "Minimal Blog Card" challenge from DevChallenges. It showcases the design and layout of a minimalist blog card. The challenge required creating a responsive card with an image, title, description, and author name, along with the usage of modern CSS properties for styling.

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned several key CSS concepts and how to apply them effectively in a real-world scenario:

- **Flexbox**: I used Flexbox for centering the content both horizontally and vertically, making the card responsive and ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Responsive Design**: I used media queries to ensure that the layout looks good on various devices, including smaller screens.
- **CSS Styling**: I refined my CSS skills by working with borders, shadows, typography, and spacing to create a visually appealing and clean design.
- **Box Model**: Understanding how padding and borders affect the layout helped me manage spacing and alignment within the card.
- **Typography**: I selected fonts from Google Fonts and ensured they complement the design, focusing on readability and consistency.
- **Card Component Design**: This project provided valuable experience in designing reusable, modular components that can be used in different web applications.

### Useful resources
